Deep neural network programmed using Python 3.8 and Tensorflow 2.2

This program allows users to load TXT and CSV data files, and run sport game predicitons.
It provides four neural network training options, and several other tools to compile data.

Please note that the genetic algorithm training methods will likely not function well on lower-end computers.
Also, note that good and large datasets are required for accurate results.

Furthermore, model evaluations displayed with predicitons will likely vary slightly.
This is normal, and due to the random sets selected for evaluation.

Also, please, if anyone is able to find good datasets I would really appreciate it if you email me at maximusmilazzo@yahoo.com or text me at (602) 980-0650.
It would be very interesting to be able to test the program with more data.

Enjoy :)
